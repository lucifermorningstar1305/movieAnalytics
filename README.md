## INFO ℹ️



🎯 **Objective** : This project is designed to derive analytics and also do some mining ⛏ on the Film :film_strip: industry timeline. 

It's a simple project showcasing the power of **Graph Database** accompanied with **Python**. 

The best part of this project is that it's simply about **fun** 🥳 🥳. 



## Dependencies 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

📌 Need to have `neo4j` installed in your system . Please visit this [link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-neo4j-on-ubuntu-20-04) if your system doesn't have Neo4j installed.

📌 Need to have `py2neo` installed. To install `py2neo` simply run this command `pip3 install py2neo`

**Disclaimer** : I faced a lot of trouble creating a database on neo4j as it's not a professional version. So I found this [neo4j-link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60429947/error-occurs-when-creating-a-new-database-under-neo4j-4-0) which worked for me.



## Data-Collection Link 👨‍💻

I have made my personal scrapper for this project, which can be found in this [GitHub-link](https://github.com/lucifermorningstar1305/scrappy). 

## NBViewer 📔📔

As GitHub won't be able to render some graphs thereby I'm attaching the `nbViewer` link for this notebook
